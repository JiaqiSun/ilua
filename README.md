This project is an example of integrating Lua with an iOS program.

It's woefully out of date in terms of iOS. Not to mention the Lua version
it uses is getting a little stale as well.

Look to see a new version soon (circa Sep 2014) updated to the latest iOS and Lua
and with an improved Lua to ObjC bridge.
